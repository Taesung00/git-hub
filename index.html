Motivation
</br>
</br>
In recent years, work out becomes a big trend. Many people are doing workout but also many people quit it easily. In my case, I restart work out but I recognised that my workout routine and exercises past 6 months are very unefficient. There some reasons why people can't do workout and exercises well. They think it is too hard, boring, they don't have time to do it or they don't know how to do it. This is a critical situation for business people and employees. Shortage of exercise can give them depression, obesity, and if it worst it can cause cancer. For these reasons, I want to make a useful workout app to support and motivate them.
</br>
</br>
Description
</br>
</br>
This application will provide many features that are related to motivation and tips for a workout. There will be 4 categories motivation, regularity, tips, and tutorial. </br>Firstly, in the motivation category, it can help when people want to give up. This category includes 2 functions. When people see the good figure of someone, they think they want to be like them. Because of it, we show pictures of famous people's figure and they can get motivation after they see it. And a wise saying helps people to do it. </br>
The second category is regularity. This category will help people to do their healthy lifestyle including diet, life routine, and regular exercise becomes a habit. This category will have two functions, timetable and alarm system. In the timetable, you can arrange workout routines, diets, and manage your meal's calories. In the alarm system, it helps your healthy lifestyle more perfect. It alerts in specific times to get up, start a workout, and eating meals. You need enough time to sleep and have to eat regular time if you want to be healthy and get more effects when you do workout and exercise.
<br>The third category is the tips. In this category, we will provide an online community for users to share their ideas or personal tips. One of the biggest reasons why workout beginners can't get great effects is they don't know what should they eat and to do. So, we will give some tips for healthy diets and workout routines that other trainers made. These exercise routines and diets can give us more efficient solutions to develop people's health.
<br>The last category is the tutorial. There will be two features. little exercises for busy people and basic workout for beginners. Accurate posture is very important when we are doing the workout. Because wrong posture exercise can harm critical effects to workout people. So, this application will provide some pictures and videos that give them an accurate posture.
<br>If you worry about the resources that we have to post, there are so many materials that we can refer to. There are so many famous trainers, athletes, and bodybuilders are sharing their life routines and diets using blogs and Youtube videos already. There are many references on the internet and we don't have to worry about it.
<br>
<br>
Tools and technologies
<br>
<br>
First of all, building app skills will be needed. When I was 16, I made the school and food roulette application. However, I learned it from many tutorial videos on Youtube. There are many other easy ways to make an application. For example, there are some developer tools or application that doesn't need any knowledge. But, it has a limitation. So, to improve application quality, we have to use other developer tools like Swift UI, Flutter, Kotlin, Firebase,  or C languages such as Python or Java. In addition, designing a tool like photoshop. In addition, this application includes an online discussion service. So, we have to lend some server for it
<br>
<br>
Skills required
<br>
<br>
As you know, an easy developer tool can be easy but it has a limit. So, we have to use other C language or application tools. Also, when we design the application, we should use some designer tools like photoshop. It looks hard to learn these things. But, there are many kind developers upload tutorial videos at Youtube, blogs, or many programming education services. Also, we can ask or get feedback from the online discussion or classmates. Also, we have to make online discussion so we have to get knowledge and management about the network.

Out comes

If this project is a success, this application will be the most useful app in the workout app. After beginners use this application, they can easily attain a workout routine and a healthy lifestyle. Furthermore, people who don't have time to do an exercise can improve their health. As a result, people can be familiar with the regular exercise so improve their unhealthy lifestyle. However, there are some obstacles that we face. Firstly, most people didn't learn photoshop or design skills before so there's no doubt that this progress can have some difficulties. As you know, I don't have much experience with making an application for using C language so this could be a difficulty too.
